# RemoteVM host enrollment

EpicVM keeps RemoteVM host records on the server. The browser never supplies an
agent URL or bearer token. Host records are read from `/opt/blobe-vm/remote-hosts.json`
(or `EPICVM_REMOTE_HOSTS_FILE`) and must be mode `0600`.

## Windows host

1. Put the Windows machine and EpicVM server in the intended Tailscale tailnet.
2. Run PowerShell 7 as Administrator on the Windows host:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\setup.ps1
```

The guided setup checks PowerShell 7, Hyper-V, and Tailscale, discovers the
Tailscale address, asks for the optional Hyper-V switch, and runs the secure
installer. For unattended setup, use `-TailscaleAddress`, `-SwitchName`, and
`-NonInteractive`.

3. Transfer the protected token file to the EpicVM server through a private
channel. Keep it mode `0600`, then run `sudo epicvm-remote-host setup`. The
server wizard prompts for the host ID, display name, Tailscale agent URL, and
protected token-file path, then probes the agent.

## Server enrollment

The CLI generates a strong token only into a protected file; it never prints the
secret. Use `token-generate --output` followed by `add --token-file` (or a
protected token file/stdin/environment source):

```bash
server/epicvm-remote-host token-generate --output /run/epicvm/agent.token
server/epicvm-remote-host add epic-pc "Epic PC" http://100.72.220.117:8765 --token-file /run/epicvm/agent.token
server/epicvm-remote-host list
server/epicvm-remote-host probe epic-pc
server/epicvm-remote-host disable epic-pc
server/epicvm-remote-host enable epic-pc
server/epicvm-remote-host remove epic-pc
```

The output of `list`, `show`, and `probe` never contains the token. Non-Tailscale
URLs (`100.64.0.0/10` or `*.ts.net`) are rejected unless the explicit
`EPICVM_ALLOW_NON_TAILSCALE_HOSTS=1` development override is set.

## Dashboard behavior

The Local VM option is always available. RemoteVM creation is enabled only for
an online registered host whose capabilities report `create_vm: true`. The
server checks host availability and capability again at submission time. VM
inventory retains the last known remote ownership metadata and labels those
cards offline if a host disconnects; lifecycle mutations are blocked until the
host is reachable again.

## Agent contract

The agent exposes JSON endpoints:

- `GET /v1/health`
- `GET /v1/capabilities`
- `GET /v1/vms`
- `POST /v1/vms`
- `POST /v1/vms/{name}/start`
- `POST /v1/vms/{name}/stop`
- `POST /v1/vms/{name}/restart`
- `DELETE /v1/vms/{name}`

Every request is bearer-authenticated. Mutation requests support an
`Idempotency-Key` and return an `X-Request-Id` header. The older
`/actions/{action}` mutation path remains as a compatibility alias.
